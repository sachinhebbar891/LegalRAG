Here are some landmark inheritance dispute cases in India that played a significant role in shaping succession laws:
1. Prakash & Ors. vs. Phulavati & Ors. (2015)
* Significance: Clarified the retrospective application of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.
* Summary: Phulavati, the daughter of a deceased man, claimed a share in ancestral property after the 2005 amendment, which granted daughters equal rights in Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) property. The Supreme Court ruled that the amendment applied only if the father was alive on or after September 9, 2005. Since Phulavati’s father had died earlier, she was denied inheritance.
2. Vineeta Sharma vs. Rakesh Sharma & Ors. (2020)
* Significance: Overruled the Prakash vs. Phulavati case and granted daughters equal coparcenary rights regardless of when their father died.
* Summary: The Supreme Court held that daughters have equal rights to ancestral property as sons under the Hindu Succession Act, even if the father died before the 2005 amendment. This decision settled long-standing confusion regarding women's property rights in Hindu families.
3. Mary Roy vs. State of Kerala (1986)
* Significance: Ensured equal inheritance rights for Christian women under the Indian Succession Act, 1925.
* Summary: Mary Roy, an activist and mother of author Arundhati Roy, challenged the discriminatory Travancore Christian Succession Act, which favored male heirs. The Supreme Court ruled that Christian women in Kerala were entitled to inherit property equally, striking down gender-based inheritance discrimination.
4. Om Prakash vs. Laxmi Narayan (2013)
* Significance: Strengthened widow’s inheritance rights.
* Summary: A widow was denied property rights by her in-laws under the assumption that she had remarried. The Supreme Court ruled that unless remarriage was legally proven, a widow’s right to her deceased husband's property could not be taken away.
5. Shagun Gupta vs. Sangeeta Jain (2021)
* Significance: Addressed inheritance rights of illegitimate children.
* Summary: The Supreme Court reaffirmed that children born out of wedlock were entitled to inherit their father’s self-acquired and ancestral property under Hindu law, securing the rights of illegitimate children.
