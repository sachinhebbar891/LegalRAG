Here are a few landmark divorce cases in India that significantly influenced the evolution of divorce laws in the country:
1. **** vs. **** (2009)
* Significance: Defined "cruelty" under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
* Summary: The Supreme Court ruled that persistent accusations without proof, baseless allegations of adultery, and mental harassment constitute cruelty. This case strengthened the legal grounds for divorce under cruelty.
2. Narasimha **** vs. **** (1973)
* Significance: Established that desertion must be intentional and without a reasonable cause to qualify as a ground for divorce.
* Summary: The wife left her husband due to his mistreatment and filed for divorce on grounds of desertion. The court ruled that since she had a valid reason to leave, it did not constitute desertion, protecting spouses from being unfairly blamed.
3. Ammini E.J. vs. Union of India (1995)
* Significance: Challenged gender discrimination in Christian divorce laws.
* Summary: The Kerala High Court ruled that Christian women should have equal rights to divorce as men under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. This case led to amendments ensuring more equitable rights for Christian women in divorce proceedings.
4. Danial **** vs. Union of India (2001)
* Significance: Clarified the rights of Muslim women under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.
* Summary: After the controversial Shah Bano case (1985), the government had limited a Muslim woman’s right to maintenance post-divorce. This case ensured that a Muslim husband must provide a reasonable and fair provision for his wife’s maintenance beyond the iddat period, balancing personal laws with constitutional rights.
5. **** vs. Union of India (2017)
* Significance: Led to the criminalization of instant Triple Talaq.
* Summary: **** challenged the practice of Talaq-e-Biddat (instant triple talaq), where a Muslim husband could unilaterally divorce his wife by saying "talaq" three times. The Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional, leading to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which banned the practice.
