Laws of Property Inheritance in India
Inheritance is a convention of passing or rather transferring properties, titles, debts, rights, and obligations to the legal heir of a person upon his/her death. It can be done by either a will or through laws of succession. The regulation of inheritance differs among religions, societies, and communities. We believe that there is no bigger pain than losing a family member, but we also believe that it is more painful to deal with any kind of family dispute regarding the inheritance of property. However, this happens in India because of a lack of knowledge about property inheritance. In the time of inflation, the prices of real states are touching the sky, and it becomes automatically essential for legal heirs to safeguard the property before and after the demise of the legitimate owner of the property. Legal owners have to go through legal formalities to acquire the ownership of their property. However, to get the property, the legal procedure and formalities may differ because of the nature of the property.
What is a will?
Under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, a will is a declaration or a legal document that contains specific details like the name of one or more persons who will acquire, manage, and get benefitted from an owner’s estate after his/her death. When the will get a certified copy, it is called as a Probate. The copy is certified with the seal of the concerned court of law that grants administration of the property to the legatee/ executor of the testator. A Probate thus acts as an evidence of the heir’s authority over a property.
Who can create a will?
A competent person with a sound mind and who is above 18 years of age and not a minor is able to create a will.
Legal heir in India?
According to India laws, a person who is determined to succeed to the estate of an ancestor who has died without making a will or mentioning a legal heir. Therefore a legal heir is an individual who takes the place of the property of his/her ancestor, either by law or by a will.

Rights of Children
According to the laws of succession in India, by his birth only, a son has right in the property of his father and grandfather. Also, a son has equivalent rights like his father in their ancestral property. In a case, when a person has separate property or a self-acquired property, and he dies without making a will, then his son, living mother, sister, grandmother, and brother have equal rights of succession in his property.
Rights of Daughters
Before the year 2005, the right share in the ancestral property was only given to unmarried daughters in India. However, in the year 2005, the equal rights and duties of a son were granted to daughters.
Rights of Adopted Child
The rights of inheritance for an adopted child in India are almost similar to a natural-born child. Also, it is noteworthy that after adoption, a child has no inheritance right over his biological family. However, if he/she acquires a property before adoption, the property will continue to be in his/her name only.
Right of Child born in live-in relationship
In the year 2008, the honorable Supreme Court of India in Vidyadhari v/s Sukhrana Bai case granted the children born in a live-in relationship, an inheritance right, and acknowledged them as legal heirs.
