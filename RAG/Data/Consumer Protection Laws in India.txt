The Consumer Protection Act defines a consumer as a person who buys goods or services for consideration (NOT for resale). Also, a consumer is who uses the goods and services with the permission of the person who purchases the goods or services. The Act covers all goods and services including banking, e-commerce, telecom, insurance, electricity, transportation in the private and public sector.

* The goods bought by him or agreed to be bought by him suffer from one or more defects;
* The services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or availed of by him suffer from a deficiency in any respect;

Note: Such service given by the service provider are the person who could have known with due diligence to be injurious to life and safety.
Procedure to File Consumer Case
Any consumer complaint relating to a good or service must be filed in writing with a District Forum by the consumer along with the fee. On receipt of a complaint, the District Forum may reject or approve the complaint, usually within 21 days from the date of complaint. On the other hand, a copy of the complaint will reach the opposite party for the approval to be made within 45 days.
The effort is taken to hear all consumer cases as expeditiously as possible. Further, it is endeavoured to decide the complaint within a period of three months from the date of receipt of notice by the opposite party. Hence, if during the proceedings, the complainant fails to appear on the date of hearing before the District Forum, the District Forum may either dismiss the complaint about default or decide it on merits.
